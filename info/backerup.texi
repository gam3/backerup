@chapter Introduction

BackerUp is a system to backup computer filesystems across possibly unreliable networks.

It relies heavily on the @emph{rsync} program to do the actual coping of files.
However it could use any program to do the actual moving of files across
the network.

Backerup is simular to these programs:

@itemize
  @item rsnapshot
  @item rsynce
@end itemize

@node Invoking, Environment Variables, Introduction, Top
@chapter Invoking

Backerup has 3 major componantes: a collector, a copier and a cleaner.

The collector is normally run as a daemon while the copier and the cleaner are run as cron jobs.

The collector is responsable for getting files across the network into a
``backup'' and contains most of the complexity of the systems. The
copier makes a copy of the ``backup'' at some given interval. The sieve
then removes older copies of the ``backup'' normally keeping one backup
for each month and one for each day on the current 5 to 10 days.

The copier takes a @emph{snapshot} of the collected files. It is a very
simple script on linux compters that dulicates the links of the
@emph{static} directory into an hourly directory.

The cleaner removes unneeded snapshots. If the copier is running hourly
the system generates a very large number of backup directories. The
cleaner removes some of these directories based on the age. An example
would be to keep 8 hours of hourly backups then only keep a backup of
every 4 hours and after 24 hours only keep a backup of very 8 hours and
after 2 days on keep 1 backup for each day, etc.

@node Environment Variables, Errors and omissions, Invoking, Top
@chapter Environment Variables

Backerup uses the following environment variables:

@table @code

@item PATH

@end table

@section design
@subsection copier

If a timeslice is added to a reconciled page some sort of error needs to be generated.

@subsection sieve

It is possible to merge one project into another.  All of the unreconsiled
times from the original project will be moved to the new project.

@subsection collector

These are notifications and can come from many sources.
A notification has a start time and my have a endtime and a type.

@node Errors and omissions, History, Environment Variables, Top

There are no bugs.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The initial system was designed and written by G. Allen Morris III.
@end itemize

BackerUp was written to improve on the features of the rsnapshot backup system.

In a remote backup system you would like to have all of the files to be
with in some age, however this may not be possible in the case of very
large files as it can take many hours is not days to copy these files
across the network.

One way to solve this problem is to copy vary large files at a reduced bandwidth
and while they are being backup continue to backup smaller files.

In order to do this you new a @emph{stable} version of the backup as
well as the @emph{working} version of the backup. Rsync copies files
into the working area and then these files are ``copied'' into the
@emph{stable} when they are copletely copied. While the @emph{stable}
version of the backup my not be complete snapshot of the remote file
system each file is complete.
