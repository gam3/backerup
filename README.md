backerup
========

/ˈbækərˈʌp/ noun, plural back·ers-up. 1. a supporter; backer; second. 2. Football. a linebacker.

This software is designed to support you in having offsite backups over slower networks.  Like a linebacker it is very tenacious about protecting the data.

Bakerup improves on the ideas that http://www.rsnapshot.com uses.  While rsnapshot is very good about limiting the amount of data that has to cross the network and the amount of disk space that is used on the backup server, it is not good about prioritizing the data, or handing failures.  Bakerup attempts to keep all of the good features of rsnapshot and remove many of is short comings.
